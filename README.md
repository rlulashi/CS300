# CS300


What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
We were instructed to create a code to help an academic advising team with recommending a degree path. The code displays a list of all courses required and their prerequisites.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
We were given choices between a vector, hash table or binary search tree to construct our code. We used Big-O notation to deduce which structure would be optimal. Each one has their own pros and cons and determining worst-case scenarios for runtime is critical in decision making.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Reviewing the learning materials and youtube helped me greatly because I had many problems getting everything to get going. Once I broke down each segment piece by piece it helped make the task not as daunting.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Asking questions early on during development of the pseudocode can clear the air if there are any misunderstandings later on.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I feel more confident in building a structure step by step and describing each part rather than looking at the entire task at once.
